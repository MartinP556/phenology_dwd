# phenology_dwd

File dwd_phenpy.py is what I use for most of the specific tastks. The first few functions in the class should have most of the useful table-specific things.

Other useful functions in files dataset_fctns.py, plotting.py, modelling_fctns.py and stats_fctns.py.

The rest is trash and will be deleted (hopefully soon).
